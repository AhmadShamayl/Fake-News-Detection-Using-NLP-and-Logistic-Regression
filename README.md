Overview
The Fake News Detection project aims to develop a machine learning model to classify news articles as real or fake. By leveraging natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms, we can analyze the content of news articles and determine their authenticity.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project is a collection of news articles with labels indicating whether they are real or fake. It includes the following columns:

id: Unique identifier for each news article
title: Title of the news article
author: Author of the news article
text: Full text of the news article
label: Label indicating whether the news is real (0) or fake (1)
Installation
To get started with this project, follow these steps:


Install the required dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage
To run the project, open the Jupyter notebook Fake News Colab.ipynb and execute the cells step-by-step. The notebook contains the following main sections:

Data Loading: Load the dataset and inspect its structure.
Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the data for model training.
Model Training: Train a machine learning model using the preprocessed data.
Model Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the trained model.
Project Structure
The repository is organized as follows:


fake-news-detection/
data/
train.csv          # Training dataset
Fake News Colab.ipynb  # Jupyter notebook with the project code
requirements.txt       # List of required Python packages
README.md              # Project README file
Results
The results of the fake news detection model will be displayed in the notebook, including accuracy scores and other evaluation metrics.
